# uowatchOS
uowatchOS allows you to get a taste of watchOS®️ watch faces on your circular Wear OS®️ watches.
It was made in Samsung's Watch Face Studio for Always On Display support and give ease to both developers and users. (watchOS is a brand of Apple Inc. and Wear OS is a brand of Google LLC. uowatchOS is not affiliated with Apple Inc. or watchOS.)

# What are the system requirements?
A circular Wear OS watch that has ADB debugging enabled. (Wear OS 4 is recommended), your desired uowatchOS version (don't look at the Latest tag, just pick the one which suits you) and an Android device to sideload the APK (more likely a smartphone) that has Wear Installer 2 installed. (If incompatible, use ADB on your PC or Bugjaeger.)
# How will I use this watch face?
For Galaxy Watches, hold your watch face, swipe quickly, and select your uowatchOS watch face. Use Galaxy Wearable for better results, the nametag of your watch face can be unofficialwatchOS or LABEL_NAME, so stay informed! (unofficialwatchOS nametag will be more likely to be used for simplicity)
# What is the safest place to download?

# Why did you make this project?
So, my friends have iPhones and Apple Watches and some on the past, my twin brother wanted an Apple Watch when he was 5, because of the butterfly watch face. Then some time to time, I started to get jealous of my friends even if I did not want to get jealous. Then after getting a Galaxy Watch5, I thought "Aww, it would be so nice if I could use watchOS watch faces or real watchOS in this watch!" Then in January 28th, I developed the first uowatchOS watch face in 5 hours, the MOST ANNOYING part was the keystore file. (My twin brother hates Apple EXTREMELY, if I'd get him an Apple product, he says he will break it!) So the main purpose is to prevent jealousy.
# Accepting any contributions?
Not now, because uowatchOS is a non-profit project, but if you want, monthly paid version bundles will be available.
Have fun!
